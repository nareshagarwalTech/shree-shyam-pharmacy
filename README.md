## Setup

### 1. Upload to GitHub
Replace all files in your existing repo with this code.

### 2. Generate App Icons

**Option A: Quick (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net
2. Upload `/public/icons/icon.svg`
3. Download generated icons
4. Extract to `/public/icons/` folder

**Option B: Manual**
Create PNG files from the SVG in these sizes:
- 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144
- 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512

### 3. Update Pharmacy Information

Edit `lib/constants.ts` and `app/(public)/page.tsx`

### 4. Set the dashboard password

The password is checked **server-side** in `/api/login` so it is not in
the JS bundle. Set it as an environment variable:

- **Local dev:** add `APP_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123` to `.env.local`
- **Vercel:** Project → Settings → Environment Variables → add `APP_PASSWORD`

Restart the dev server (or redeploy) after changing it.

### 5. Deploy

Vercel will auto-deploy after GitHub push.
